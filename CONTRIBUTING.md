## 🔧 Development Setup

To set up the project locally, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md#installation). Ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v8 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)

After setting up, run the frontend (`npm run dev` in `/client`) and backend (`node index.js` in `/server`) to test your changes.

## 📏 Coding Standards

- **Code Style**: Follow JavaScript and React best practices. Use Prettier for formatting (run `npm run format` if configured).
- **File Structure**: Maintain the existing folder structure (`/client` for frontend, `/server` for backend).
- **Comments**: Add clear comments for complex logic.
- **Testing**: Test your changes locally. If adding features, include relevant tests (if applicable).
- **Dependencies**: Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies. Update `package.json` if new ones are required.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

  - A descriptive title (e.g., "Login fails with invalid credentials").
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - Expected vs. actual behavior.
  - Screenshots or logs, if relevant.
